The UI

-----------------------------------------------------------

Text
- the text needs a bit of padding its too much on the edge

-----------------------------------------------------------

Buttons
- The clickable area is only text at the moment and that is challenging and time consuming
- The clickable area should be the whole button and the area around it. 



------------------------------------------------------------

Navigation
- there is only a back button and missing the next button
- there is need to go to the next step without having to go back to the main journey layout.
