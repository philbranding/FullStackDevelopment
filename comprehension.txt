Main Function
---------------------------------------------------


Always have the Main function of the product in mind
Features are not the main function of a product

Taxi - Transportation 
Pizza Restaurant - serving Pizza as Food
Hotel - overnight stays for people
Smartphone - Calling or Texting and Communication via the Internet


The First Principle
-----------------------------------------------------
Use the First Principles Method to approach a problem.
- It is the same as divide and conquere approach only that you still have to go back to the fundamental components that make up a problem that you are trying to solve.

STEP 1: Identify and define your current assumptions. 
STEP 2: Breakdown the problem into its fundamental principles. 
STEP 3: Create new solutions from scratch.



Understand
------------------------------------------------------
Do research on 
- StackOverflow
- Google
- Ask peers 

Understanding the problem will provide clarity on solving the problem
Research will shed some light on how others have approached the problem before
and it helps to reinvent the wheel. This helps to save time and resourses.



Map a plan
------------------------------------------------------
When approching a problem, have a strategy and always plan ahead and create major steps that 
will lead to the solution. #Divide and Conquer 


Debug 
-------------------------------------------------------
Trial and error is key in trying to arrive at a solution
Keep trying until the solution is bug free and working as 
desired

If there are errors, you do not have to worry. Find help by doing research and asking others.
